**Introduction**
This project aims to analyze the Shakespeare corpus to find the most frequently used words. I'll use Python to download the corpus, process the text, and count the word frequencies.
**Data Source**
The Shakespeare corpus is a collection of all works by William Shakespeare. The data is available from the following URL: https://norvig.com/ngrams/shakespeare.txt

**Process Overview**

1. Download the Shakespeare corpus.
2. Convert the text to lowercase.
3. Tokenize the text into individual words.
4. Count the frequency of each word.
5. Display the most common words.

**Result**
Here are the most frequent words in the Shakespeare corpus:

In this project, I successfully analyzed the Shakespeare corpus using Python. I identified the most frequently used words, with 'the' being the most common. 
This analysis provides insights into Shakespeare's use of language and common word patterns.
